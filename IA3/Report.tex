\section{Model Selection for KNN}

\subsection{Implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm}
The K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm is implemented in Python in the file knn.py

In implementing the KNN algorithm, we first read in the datat from the provided csv. The data is 
in the form of an Nx31 dimentional matrix. The dataset constitutes 30 features with the first 
value being the true class label. For example:\\

1, 19.59, 25, 127.7, 1191, 0.1032, 0.09871, 0.1655, 0.09063, ..., 0.2293, 0.06091\\

In this case, the true class value is 1, meaning that it is malignant. If it were benign, the true
 class value would be -1.

The implementation reads in each line of the csv, removes the first value as the true class value 
then uses the following 30 features to determine the distance between data points. Before the 
distance between two points can be calculated, the scale for each feature must be determined and 
the feature scaled to be all in the same range (for example [0, 1]).

We can use the Euclidian or straight line distance to determine the distance between two points 
\(x\) and \(x_i\) with m features.

\[ x = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m \end{array} \right], x_i = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_{i1} \\ \vdots \\ x_{im} \end{array} \right] \]
\[ D(x,x_i) = ||x - x_i|| \]
\[ D(x,x_i) = \sqrt{(x - x_i)^T(x - x_i)} \]
\[ D(x,x_i) = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1,...,m} (x_j - x_{ij})^2} \]

For each line in the csv, its k nearest neighbors will be used to determine its value.\\
